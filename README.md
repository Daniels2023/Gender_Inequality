# Gender Inequality Project
This project aims to visualise gender inequality around the world based on Human Development in these countries. The base of these inequalities in this project are **Education** and **Workforce**, these indicators will be demonstrated in average percentual (cards), percentage of total population (scatterplots), countries with the lowest rates of female education (barcharts) and wordcloud webscrapping. Our main dataset is from Kaggle webpage and that was used to make an interactive cards, scatterplots and barcharts and, we also used 7 websites for the cloud word webscrapping.
